# Individual Project - Nicole Steck

I'm currently undecided on my individual project, but am looking at two different possibilities at this time. These are 
documented in brief below.

## Idea 1: LinkedIn Notes app

The first possibility is an add-on that sits on top of LinkedIn and adds additional 
functionality for end users. 
<br /><br />Problem statement - you connect with people on LI all the time, and those you interact with frequently you remember/know 
the context behind your connection. With others, though, it can be hard to remember how you met someone, why you know them, 
or why they matter.
<br /><br />Solution - an application that sits on top of linkedin that allows you to categorize your LI contacts, add notes to their 
profiles or to your contacts list that are visible only to you, add additional contact information, etc.


## Idea 2: Wiki+

The second possibility is a research aid similar in nature and intent to Wikipedia, but integrated with a browser.
<br /><br />Problem statement: At this point the internet is saturated with how-tos and tutorials. Most of them suck, and it's hard 
to find exactly what you're looking for when you need it.
<br /><br />Solution: an application that sits on top of your browser 
(perhaps one specific browser? this part i don't really have a grasp of yet and would want to discuss with you) and 
essentially parses the text on a page as you read it. if the text references a specific skill, ability, etc., something
someone might want to watch a tutorial for, the application goes out and compares results found on youtube, wikipedia,  
google/the internet at large, and returns the one that has had the highest success rate according to other users of this 
application.
